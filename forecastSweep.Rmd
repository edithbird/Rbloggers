This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

```{r libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(forecast)
library(timekit)
library(geofacet)
library(tidyquant)
library(sweep)
```



```{r}
states <- tibble(abbreviation = state.abb) %>% mutate(fred_code = paste0(abbreviation, "NGSP")) %>% select(2:1)
states
states_gdp <- states_gdp %>%
    tq_get(get = "economic.data", from = "2007-01-01", to = "2017-06-01") 
states_gdp <- allStates %>% nest()
states_gdp
states_gdp <- states_gdp %>%
    mutate(data_ts = map(data, tk_ts, freq = 1, start = 2007, silent = TRUE))
states_gdp
```


Get all states

```{r}
states_gdp <- tq_get(states, get = "economic.data", from = "2007-01-01", to = "2017-06-01") %>% rename(gdp = price)
head(states_gdp, 20)
states_gdp <- allStates %>%
    select(-fred_code) %>%
    group_by(abbreviation)
states_gdp
states_gdp <- states_gdp %>%
    nest()
states_gdp

```





Convert from tibble to ts using timekit



```{r}
NB <- tq_get("NENGSP", get = "economic.data", from = "2007-01-01", to = "2017-06-01") %>% rename(gdp = price)
head(NB)
NB

us_gdp <- NB %>% tk_ts(start = 2017, freq = 1, silent = T)
us_fir_arima <- auto.arima(us_gdp)
sw_glance(us_fir_arima)
us_forecast <- forecast(us_fir_arima, h = 3)
us_forecast
```

Tidy the forecast

```{r}
nb_sweep <- sw_sweep(us_forecast, timekit_idx = T, rename_index = "date")
nb_sweep
```


Plot

```{r}
nb_sweep %>% ggplot(aes(x = date, y = gdp, color = key)) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lo.95, ymax = hi.95, fill = "red", color = NA, size = 0)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lo.80, ymax = hi.80, fill = key), fill = "blue3", size = 0, alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_line(size = 1) + geom_point(size = 2) + theme_tq(base_size = 16) + scale_color_tq() + labs(title = "NE GDP, 3 Yr Forecast", x = "", y = "GDP, US $ Millions")
  
```
